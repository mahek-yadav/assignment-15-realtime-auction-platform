npm install
```

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

or:

```bash
npm start
```

Open:

`http://localhost:5000`

## Test With Multiple Users

Open the auction page in three browser tabs.

Example users:

- Vikram
- Ananya
- Viewer

Test the following:

1. Join the auction from all three tabs.
2. Place a bid from Vikram.
3. Verify that every connected tab receives the new highest bid.
4. Place a higher bid from Ananya.
5. Verify that Vikram receives the targeted outbid alert.
6. Wait until the timer is below 15 seconds.
7. Place a valid bid and verify the timer extends to 20 seconds.
8. Let the timer reach zero.
9. Verify the auction is sold to the highest bidder.
10. Try another bid and verify that it is rejected.

## API

### Health Check

`GET /api/health`

Example response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Auction server is running",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Auctions

`GET /api/auctions`

Returns the current in-memory auction state.

## Socket Events

### Client → Server

#### `auction:join`

```json
{
  "auctionId": "AUC_VINTAGE_99",
  "username": "Vikram"
}
```

#### `bid:place`

```json
{
  "auctionId": "AUC_VINTAGE_99",
  "amount": 54000
}
```

### Server → Client/Room

- `auction:init`
- `auction:time_tick`
- `user:joined`
- `user:left`
- `bid:success`
- `bid:outbid`
- `bid:rejected`
- `auction:extended`
- `auction:sold`

## Important Note

This assignment uses in-memory state. Auction data is reset whenever the server restarts or redeploys.

## Deployment

The application is configured to use Render's dynamic `PORT` environment variable:

```js
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
```

Render settings:

- Runtime: Node
- Build Command: `npm install`
- Start Command: `npm start`

No database is required for this assignment.
